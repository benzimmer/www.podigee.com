<h2>Basic editing</h2>

<p>To edit a field just click into the it's input box and change the content. Your changes will be saved as soon as you leave the box or click the <strong>Save</strong> button in the top right corner of the form. You will then see a notification if the change was successful or if there was an error.</p>

<h2>The Podigee publishing assistant</h2>

<p>On the right side of the screen you can see your progress while entering the details for your podcast. Here we show you which data is still missing to publish the podcast and make it findable by and appealing to your future listeners.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<h4>
<strong>Title</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>Enter the name of your podcast here. As you might have guessed choosing a good name is important not only for recognisability by potential listeners, but also for finding it in directories and search engines. Don't make it too generic, but also not too complicated to pronounce.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Default Authors</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>A comma separated list of the members of the podcast.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Subtitle</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>A short tagline that could be an extension of the podcast's title or informs the listener about the topic of the podcast.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Description</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>A more detailed description about the podcasts topic(s) to give your future listeners an idea what your podcast is about. The description should not be longer than 4000 characters.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Copyright</strong> - optional</h4>

<p>Something like <em>Â© Your Name</em> for example, but you can also include a link to a creative commons license.</p>

<h2>Blog / Website</h2>

<h4>
<strong>Subdomain</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>The name of the blog is a subdomain that can only contain letters A-Z, a-z, numbers 0-9 and dashes.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Domain</strong> - optional</h4>

<p>Your own domain for the podcast / blog. Before you change this, make sure you read the according <a href="/docs/domain-configuration">documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Theme</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>Choose a theme for your blog. You can also create your own themes by clicking your name in the top right corner and then choosing <strong>Themes</strong>.</p>

<h4>
<strong>Blog header image</strong> - optional</h4>

<p>The image that will be shown as the main image of your blog, it will look like a banner image most of the time.</p>

<h2>Feeds</h2>

<h4><strong>Feed links</strong></h4>

<p>Here are the links to all feeds your podcast has. They only differ in the format the audio file is in. If you don't know which one to use for submitting to directories choose the one ending in <em>aac</em>.</p>

<h4><strong>Number of feed items</strong></h4>

<p>Here you can change how many episodes appear in the podcast feed. By default the latest 10 episodes are included. You can choose to include up to 100 episodes in the feed.</p>

<p><em><strong>A word of warning</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Do not set the number of episodes too high. If your episode metadata is large (for example if it has a lot of text for show notes) some podcast clients (including iTunes) will not be able to read your feed properly.</em></p>

<p><em>To provide a solution for this, Podigee offers paged feeds. This allows podcast clients to find all episodes. This keeps feed sizes low by only showing the latest episodes and adds further information to the feed that allows a podcast client to find all episodes of a podcast.</em></p>

<p><em>Unfortunately only a few clients support this. If you would like your favorite podcast client to support it too, please write them a message and point them to this URL: http://podlove.org/paged-feeds/</em></p>

<h4><strong>Subscribe button</strong></h4>

<p>Here you can enable and configure the <a href="/blog/subscribe-to-podcast-the-podlove-subscribe-button">Podlove Subscribe Button</a> for you podcast.</p>

<h2>Cover image</h2>

<p>The cover image is used by podcast clients like iTunes and as important as the podcasts title when it comes to branding your podcast.. We recommend use a 2048x2048px jpg or png image here.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>Here you can configure the audio quality for your podcast episodes. If you change this later on it will only affect episodes you encode after you changed the settings. Old episodes will not be reencoded when this setting is changed.</p>

<p>Choose <strong>Normal</strong> for conversational podcasts, <strong>High</strong> for podcasts with a lot of music and <strong>Super High</strong> if your listeners are true audiophiles with a lot of bandwidth. Please keep in mind that, the higher you set the audio quality the larger the files to download will get, so only change this if you really have the need for it.</p>

<p>We worked closely with the audio experts from <a href="http://www.auphonic.com">Auphonic</a> to create <a href="/docs/media-qualities">sensible defaults</a> for those settings.</p>

<h2>Classification</h2>

<h4>
<strong>Category</strong> - mandatory</h4>

<p>The category helps the listener to know what your podcast is about.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit language</strong></p>

<p>Some podcast clients have parental control features which allow to filter podcasts if they contain explicit language or adult content.</p>

<p><strong>Language</strong> - mandatory</p>

<p>The language your podcast does mainly use. If your podcast is multilingual, you can use the keywords to specify it.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong> - optional</p>

<p>The keywords allow to classify the podcast. Adding keywords is like tagging the podcast. Use one or two words to describe what the main topics of the podcast are in order to allow listeners to know what they should expect, for example music, news, interviews, rock, heavy metal.</p>

<h2>Connections</h2>

<p>Here you can connect social accounts on Twitter, Facebook and App.net to Podigee. These will show up on the podcast website automatically and you can configure to automatically post to these services when you publish a new episode.</p>

<p>Additionally you can enter your flattr ID to show a flattr button for each episode.</p>

<h2>Collaborators</h2>

<p>If you produce your podcast together with other people you can invite them as collaborators to the podcast. This allows them to change podcast settings and to create, edit and publish new episodes.</p>

<p>If your collaborator does not have an account on Podigee yet, he or she will be prompted to created one in the invitation email. Of course the account is free for them, no matter if you are on a paid plan or not.</p>

<h2>More options</h2>

<h4><strong>Redirects</strong></h4>

<p>If you should ever decide to leave Podigee, we still got you covered. Here you can redirect your website and feed to a new address. So no matter what your future plans are, we won't lock you in.</p>

<h4><strong>Danger zone</strong></h4>

<p>Please be extremely careful here. If you delete your podcast it will no longer be available for download and all episodes including audio files will be deleted. If you ever manage to do this by accident, please contact us immediately, chance might be that we still can recover your data from our backups.</p>
