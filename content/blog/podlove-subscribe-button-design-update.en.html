                <p>Almost two years ago we introduced the Podlove Subscribe Button and we're still the only podcast hosting platform that brings this massive simplification of the subscription process out-of-the-box.</p>
                
                <p>A few days ago we not enabled the button to be enabled by default for all our podcasters, but also updated to the newest version of the button. This features a very nice design update as well as a few more options to adapt it to the design of your website. It is now much easier to change it's color and also it's general appearance on the page.</p>
