                <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                
                <p>As a Podigee customer you can activate the transcription feature in the media tab in the podcast interface:</p>
                
                <p class="block-img"><img src="/blog/screen-shot-2016-12-10-at-10.25.48.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-12-10-at-10.25.48" width="1420" height="962"></p>
                
                <p>After that, you are ready to go! Now you can go and create a new episode as usual. After uploading and encoding the audio file, a machine-generated transcript will be generated. You will see the following screen in the "Transcript" tab:</p>
                
                <p class="block-img"><img src="/blog/screen-shot-2016-12-10-at-10.30.43.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-12-10-at-10.30.43" width="1420" height="675"></p>
                
                <p>Now clicking on the "<em>Edit transcript</em>" button will open the transcript editor. This is a very convenient way to refine the transcript. The transcript editor looks like this:</p>
                
                <p class="block-img"><img src="/blog/screen-shot-2016-12-10-at-10.45.34.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-12-10-at-10.45.34" width="1420" height="539"></p>
                
                <p>You can use the buttons on the bottom to play the audio or to save the text. Once you are finished, you can close the editor and publish your fresh new episode!</p>
