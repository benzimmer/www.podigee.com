                <p>Last weekend we finally flipped the switch and enabled the Podigee Podcast Player for all podcasters using Podigee to publish their podcasts. This change will allow us to build new great features like full support for transcripts and other additions to your podcast's audio content, like images, geodata and supplemental material like PDFs and other document formats.</p>
                
                <p>We already enabled the player last weekend and everything seems to be going smooth. However, if you encounter anything odd, please let us know by <a href="mailto:hello@podigee.com">sending us an email</a>.</p>
                
                <p>If you want to learn more about the player, please have a look at it's new home on our website: <a href="https://www.podigee.com/en/podcast-player">Podigee Podcast Player</a></p>
