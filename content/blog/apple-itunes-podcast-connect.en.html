                <p>Until now the only way to get a new podcast into the <strong>iTunes Podcast Directory</strong> was to go through the iTunes software. With Apple's new <a href="https://podcastsconnect.apple.com">iTunes Podcast Connect</a> site that has changed. Since today you can not only <strong>submit your feeds</strong> using the new website, but you also can see the status of your submission, <strong>edit</strong> feed URLs and even <strong>delete</strong> a podcast from the directory without having to go through email support.</p>
                
                <p>If you want to know how to <strong>use the new service</strong> have a look at our <a href="https://www.podigee.com/docs/how-to-submit-your-podcast-to-itunes">updated guide to submit your podcast to the iTunes directory</a>.</p>
