              <div class="blog-text m-t-30">
                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - The Podigee Podcast Player is now available for testing, if you are hosting your podcast with us please contact us with the in-app messenger or <a href="mailto:hello@podigee.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20test%20the%20Podigee%20Podcast%20Player">send us an email</a> and we will enable it for your account.</p>
                
                <h2>Why a new player?</h2>
                
                <p>Podcasts have special requirements when it comes to playback. That's why you're probably not using an app made for listening to music to listen to a podcast. Those requirements range from special playback controls, like buttons for skipping forward in the current episode, jumping to a <strong>chaptermark</strong> or changing <strong>playback speed</strong>, to something like support for advanced supplementary content like chaptermarks or transcripts.</p>
                
                <p>Standard web players just don't have the kind of functionality that we wanted to provide to our podcasters, so we sat down and developed the <strong>Podigee Podcast Player</strong>.</p>
                
                <h2>Why should I use it for my podcast?</h2>
                
                <ol>
<li>The Podigee Podcast Player uses <strong>modern web technology</strong> to support playback on a wide range of devices from normal desktop computers to tablets, mobile phones. We're also experimenting with bringing podcasts to your TV by supporting playback to Google's Chromecast.</li>
<li>It is easily <strong>embeddable</strong>, allowing you to use it on your private Blog powered by Wordpress or your corporate website powered by a sophisticated content management system.</li>
<li>It is fully <strong>themeable</strong>, which allows to make the player look exactly like you want it to and allows it to fit into a lot of different website styles. The default themes delivered with the player are of course responsive, meaning they adapt their appearance to the screen size they are displayed on.</li>
<li>It's built with <strong>extensibility</strong> in mind and most of the default functionality is actually an <strong>extension</strong> of the basic player. This allows us to keep up with evolving requirements podcasts will have in the future and always stay on top of things.</li>
<li>It supports <strong>advanced podcast metadata</strong> like chaptermarks, shownotes, transcripts and many more in the future.</li>
<li>It has a built-in <strong>playlist</strong>, that makes your whole episode catalog available directly in the player.</li>
<li>Listeners can easily <strong>share</strong> or <strong>download</strong> you latest episode directly from the player.</li>
</ol>
                
                <h2>How can I use it?</h2>
                
                <p>There are two different options here:</p>
