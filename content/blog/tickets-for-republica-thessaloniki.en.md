Having partnered with re:publica for their main event in may this year to make all talks available in your podcatcher, we we're really happy they asked us if we would do the same for their satellite events in Dublin and Thessaloniki.

With Dublin already over we still have two tickets to the event in Thessaloniki starting tomorrow. If you're interested, let us know why you should be the one going on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/podigee) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/podigee) and we'll choose one of you to receive the tickets.

In the meantime your should definitely [check out Podigee](https://www.podigee.com), our smart little Podcast Hosting service!
