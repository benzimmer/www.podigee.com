                <p>Today we removed the restrictions for how many podcasts can be created. Now every plan can have as many podcasts as needed. This also removes the limit of how many themes can be created.</p>
                
                <p>We think this makes it easier to find out which plan you need because it mainly depends on how many hours of audio content you produce per month and if you need higher audio bitrates for your productions. It also facilitates trying out something new without the need to switch plans or create a second account.</p>
                
                <p>This is also part of our effort to offer a transparent service to our users. The simplified pricing reflects our cost for storing and delivering your content 1:1 and doesn't have any artificial restrictions anymore.</p>
