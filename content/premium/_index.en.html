        <h3>How does Podigee Premium actually work?</h3>
        <p>
          Podigee Premium allows you, as podcaster, to provide your individual, premium content to your supporters. For this you put freely configurable time subscriptions / packages and offer them to your audience. If a listener then chooses one of these packages, they will receive access to your premium listing for a paid period (via a secure, customized feed). If the time package is about to expire, we will send a reminder e-mail that will help your listeners easily renew their subscription. On the other hand, if the listener stops subscribing, his feed access ends automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          To showcase your offer accordingly, you can also create a landing page in a few minutes where you explain exactly what packages you offer and what content your fans may expect when they become supporters. This page is the one-stop shop for your premium listing - you can link to it from your website or promote it in your podcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way: On your landing page, you can also offer packages and feeds for multiple of your podcast productions - you have all the freedom to decide.

        <h3>Are gift or promotional codes possible?</h3>
        <p>
					Yes! Your listeners can also buy subscriptions for third parties - they will then receive a gift code, which they can simply send by email or print out. As a podcast producer, you can also create codes yourself and then distribute them as part of promo campaigns or sweepstakes.
