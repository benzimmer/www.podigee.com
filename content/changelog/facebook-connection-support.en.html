                  <p>It is now possible to add a link to your Facebook page, next to other social media connections like Twitter or App.net. Go to your podcast editing page and choose the tab Connections. There, you will find a new field Facebook. Once you have filled out the Facebook field, the link to your page will be shown in your blog. If you use a custom theme, you can use the template attribute <em>podcast.connections.facebook</em>.</p>
