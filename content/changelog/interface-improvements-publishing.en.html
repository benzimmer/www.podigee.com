<div class="content">
                  <p>We have started to make small improvements to the interface. This is an ongoing effort with the goal to declutter the interface and make daily actions more obvious for beginners and faster to use for experienced users. Additionally we will add information about the podcasts- and episodes-statistics in useful places over the next weeks.</p>
