                  <p>Today we have launched a feature called <strong>Blog Announcement</strong>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Some of our users asked if we could add a new kind of posts which would not be episodes, but would only contain text information. Some podcasters do this on their blog in order to announce stuff like issues or important changes. We have been thinking about making this feature fit into our interface and we decided to include a unique announcement field that will typically be shown on top of the episode list, in your blog.</p>
                  
                  <p>You can use markdown in the editor, just like in the show notes. Just add some text and it will be automatically saved. If you go to your blog, you will see that the announcement is visible on top of the blog page:</p>
                  
                  <p class="block-img"><img src="/changelog/blog-announcement.png" alt="blog-announcement" width="1400" height="797"></p>
                  
                  <p>If you are using a custom theme, you can add this feature by using the new template attribute <em>blog.announcement</em>.</p>
