                  <p>Podigee now supports extracting metadata like title, subtitle and description from an audio file. A perfect use case for this is <strong>mobile podcasting:</strong> You record an episode on the road, already add basic metadata to the media file and upload it to Dropbox (for example). Then go to Podigee, create a new episode, choose the prepared media file from you Dropbox and hit <strong>Encode</strong>. The metadata you added to the file will be extracted and added to the episode information. Currently we extract the <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Subtitle</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields as well as the <strong>chapter marks</strong> (including images and links). If you need other information imported please use the <em>feedback button</em> on Podigee to tell us and we will have a look if it is possible to add it to the list.</p>
