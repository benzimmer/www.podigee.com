                  <p>Until now you could only enter your Twitter name and it would be shown on the blog. Now you can connect your twitter account to Podigee and automatically post updates to Twitter when an episode is published.</p>
                  
                  <p>Here you can set up your Twitter account and the text to be posted.<br>This is how it looks like after you published your next episode.<br>The same functionality will follow soon for App.net and Facebook Page connections!</p>
