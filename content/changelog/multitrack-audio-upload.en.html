<div class="content">
                  <p>Podigee now supports uploading multitrack recordings. So if you already record separate tracks for different speakers or music/effects, you can now upload those individually. This has many advantages over uploading an already mixed version, some available already now, some in the near future.</p>
                  
                  <p>First the audio post processing step through Auphonic will be much more effective when using their <a href="https://auphonic.com/multitrack#features">multitrack algorithms</a>. Soon we will also launch automated transcripts for your podcast content, which will also greatly benefit from multitrack uploads. Additionally we are working on displaying speaker activity in our <a href="https://www.podigee.com/en/podcast-player">podcast web player</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Multitrack uploads will be available for all <a href="https://www.podigee.com/en/podcast-hosting/plans">paid plans</a>.</p>
