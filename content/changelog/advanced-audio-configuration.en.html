                  <p>Our partner when it comes to audio postprocessing, Auphonic, offers a <a href="https://auphonic.com/audio_examples">range of algorithms</a> that improve the quality of recordings. We worked together with Auphonic to create a default configuration that works well for most podcast formats. If you have special requirements you can now turn on or off algorithms and fine tune their parameters where possible.</p>
