<div class="content">
                  <p>After we enabled Twitter connections some time ago we now add the ability to connect your Facebook page and automatically post updates to it's wall when a new episode is pubished.</p>
                  
                  <p>Here you can set up your Facebook account and the text to be posted.</p>
                  
                  <p>This is how it looks like after you published your next episode.</p>
                  
                  <p>The same functionality will follow soon for App.net connections!</p>
