<div class="content">
                  <p>With help from <a href="https://www.auphonic.com">Auphonic</a> we are now able to extract chaptermarks from uploaded M4A/MP4 files. So if you already added chapter marks with GarageBand or Hindenburg they will show up in the Podigee chapter mark editing interface after encoding.</p>
