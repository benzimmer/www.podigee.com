<div class="content">
                  <p>We're really proud and happy to finally bring the Podlove Subscribe Button to our platform. If you would like to know more about the co-production of the <a href="http://podlove.org/">Podlove</a> and <a href="https://www.podigee.com">Podigee</a> teams have a look at our <a href="https://www.podigee.com/blog/subscribe-to-podcast-the-podlove-subscribe-button">introductory blog post</a>.</p>
                  
                  <p class="block-img"><img src="/changelog/subscribe-button.png" alt="subscribe-button" width="1400" height="1052"></p>
                  
                  <p>If you use one of the default themes you can now enable and configure the button in the <strong>Feeds</strong> tab of your podcast's settings. If you have customized your theme you can still configure it in the settings, but have to add the button to your theme. To do this use the <em>{{subscribe_button}}</em> template tag (<a href="http://docs.podigee.com/guides/themes/custom_template_attribute_reference/#subscribe-button">see our documentation for more</a>).</p>
