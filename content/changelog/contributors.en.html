                  <p>You can now add one or more contributors to a podcast and individual episodes. Currently this will only used for assigning speakers to multitrack uploads, but will find more and more use in future features coming to Podigee. Already planned are support in our upcoming automatic transcripts feature and displaying speaker activity in our podcast web player.</p>
