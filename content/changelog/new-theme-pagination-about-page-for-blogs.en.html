<div class="content">

                  <p>A new theme has been added! Just go to your Blog settings and choose 'One column' as your theme to use it.</p>

                  <p>The overview pages of the blogs are now paginated. For now there will be 10 episodes on each page. If there is demand for it we will make this number configurable in the future.</p>
