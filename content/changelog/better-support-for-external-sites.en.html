                  <p>Podigee users have always been able to use their own website and only use Podigee for audio file hosting and the embeddable web player.</p>
                  
                  <p>Although providing a all-in-one solution, we of course know that podcasters mostly already have a website and so we decided to make using it with Podigee a lot easier. You can now provide an external address for podcasts and episodes. This will be used in the feed and web player and should give your listeners a much smoother experience.</p>
