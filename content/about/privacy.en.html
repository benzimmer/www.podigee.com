          <p>Podigee operates several websites including podigee.com and podigee.io. It is Podigee’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

          <h3 id="website-visitors">Website Visitors</h3>
          <p>Like most website operators, Podigee collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Podigee’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Podigee’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Podigee may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

          <p>Podigee also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on podigee.io blogs. Podigee only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

          <h3 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Certain visitors to Podigee’s websites choose to interact with Podigee in ways that require Podigee to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Podigee gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a trial at podigee.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Podigee – by purchasing access to the paid features, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Podigee collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Podigee. Podigee does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

          <h3 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
          <p>Podigee may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Podigee may monitor the most popular podcasts on the podigee.com site or use spam screened by our comment system to help identify spam. Podigee may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Podigee does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

          <h3 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Podigee discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Podigee’s behalf or to provide services available at Podigee’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Podigee’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Podigee will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Podigee discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Podigee believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Podigee, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Podigee website and have supplied your email address, Podigee may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Podigee and our products. We primarily use our product blog and changelog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Podigee takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

          <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
          <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Podigee uses cookies to help Podigee identify and track visitors, their usage of Podigee website, and their website access preferences. Podigee visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Podigee’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Podigee’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

          <h3 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h3>
          <p>If Podigee, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Podigee goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Podigee may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

          <h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
          <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Podigee may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Podigee’s sole discretion. Podigee encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a podigee.com account, you should also check your dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
