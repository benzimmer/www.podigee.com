          <h3>We respect your data!</h3>
          <p>
            We are pleased that you’re taking an interest in our website. The trust of all visitors and customers, the security of your data and the protection of your privacy are extremely important to us. We therefore handle your personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations and this data protection notice. Personal data is information that can be used to identify you, including (for example) your real name, address or telephone number.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you visit and use our website without registering or otherwise explicitly providing information to us, we process the data transmitted to us with every request of your browser (see “Log data” below). If you explicitly provide us with personal data (e.g. using our contact form), this is done for the sole purpose of each request or order. Please note that data transmission on the Internet can never be completely protected against access by third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following, we would like to tell you what data we process, when and for what purpose. We explain how our services work and how we ensure the protection of your personal data in this regard.
          </p>

          <h3>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3>
          <p>
            If we obtain consent from the data subject to process personal data, Art. 6 (1) letter (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Art. 6 (1) letter (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. The same applies to the necessary steps taken at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If the processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, Art. 6 (1) letter (c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the processing of personal data is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, Art. 6 (1) letter (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, Art. 6 (1) letter (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing.
          </p>

          <h3>Data erasure and duration of storage</h3>
          <p>
            The personal data of the data subject is erased as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies. In addition, personal data may be stored beyond that time if required by European or national laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. The data will then also be blocked or erased when the retention period prescribed by the aforementioned laws and regulations expires, unless continued storage of the data is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract.
          </p>

          <h3>Your rights</h3>
          <p>
          </p>
            You have the right to free information about your personal data stored with us and where applicable, the right to the rectification, restriction of processing, or erasure of this data. You also have the right to data portability. Finally, you also have the right to complain to the data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data.

          <p>
            Please also note that you may object at any time to the future processing of your personal data in accordance with the legal requirements of Art. 21 GDPR. In particular, you may object to processing for purposes of direct advertising.
          </p>

          <h3>Provision of information</h3>
          <p>
            If you have questions about the collection, processing or use of your personal data, or if you would like to request information or the rectification, blocking or erasure of data, or if you wish to revoke any granted consents or object to a certain use of data, please send us an e-mail at the following e-mail address:
          </p>
          <p>
            Email: privacy@podigee.com
          </p>

          <h3>Log data</h3>
          <p>
            The automatic collection and storage of log data by the provider of Internet services are done because the processing of such data is necessary in order to display our website to you and ensure stability and security. Log data includes the following information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data and time of each request </li>
            <li>Internet address (URL) that was requested </li>
            <li>URL which the visitor visited immediately beforehand</li>
            <li>Browser and language used</li>
            <li>Operating system and user interface used</li>
            <li>IP address and host name of the visitor</li>
            <li>Access status / http status code</li>
            <li>Each data quantity transmitted</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data is transmitted to us automatically and cannot be attributed to you personally without undue effort. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 letter (f) GDPR because this data processing is necessary for the operation and display of the website. The data is erased as soon as it is no longer required to fulfill the purpose for which they were collected. With respect to the data collected for the purpose of providing the website, this is the case when each session ends. The collection of data for the purpose of providing the website and the storage of the data in log files are absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. The user therefore has no possibility of objecting to the collection and storage of such data.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            We use so-called cookies to make the experience of visiting our website attractive and allow for the use of certain functions. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your terminal device and store certain information to be exchanged with our system. The legal basis for the processing of this data is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 letter (f) GDPR. Some of the cookies we use are erased again after the end of the browser sessions, meaning when you close the browser (transient cookies). These cookies particularly include session cookies, which store a unique identifier (session ID). This session ID makes it possible to attribute the different requests of your browser to the same session. This way, your terminal device can be recognized again when you return to our website during the same session. Session cookies are also erased when you log out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other cookies remain on your terminal device for a predefined period of time and enable us to recognize your browser or terminal device the next time you visit us (persistent cookies).
          </p>
          <p>
            When you log in to your user account on our website, we use persistent cookies to recognize your terminal device again the next time you visit even after you have closed the browser. This way, you do not need to log in again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that certain cookies are placed as soon as you enter our website. You can adjust your browser settings to be informed of the placement of cookies and decide whether to accept them on a case-by-case basis or generally prevent the acceptance of cookies in certain cases, particularly including third-party cookies. If you do not accept cookies, the functionality of our website may be limited for you.
          </p>

          <h3>Configuration of cookie settings in the browser</h3>
          <p>
            You have the option of preventing the storage of cookies on your computer by adjusting your browser settings. Every browser manages cookie settings in a different way.

          <h3>Encryption with SSL</h3>
          <p>
            For security reasons, our website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. It protects transmitted data so they cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize successful encryption when the protocol designation in the status bar of your browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and a closed lock symbol appears there.
